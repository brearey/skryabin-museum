Kerdem, Dean of the Yakut churches, priest Vasily Berezhnee, gave a report to His High Priesthood Milentius - Bishop of Yakutsk and Vilyui; "I have the honor to humbly convey that with the blessing of your High Priesthood, the foundation of the Kachikat Nicholas Church on the Lyutenge River was done by me on April 24, 1892." (Manuscript by N. D. Tordeev.)</p>

                            <summary>More details</summary>
                            <p class="text__blined"> For the construction of the Kachikat church, according to the contract, a certain Chagin was the contractor, probably from the Yakut merchants or an entrepreneur. Among the local residents, Pyotr Tikhonov, nicknamed Chemchok from the Kachikatsky nasleg, and Nikolai Alekseevich Borisov, nicknamed Barieskin from 2 Zhemkonsky nasleg, were experts in the construction of Russian houses. In 1906-1909. Gavriil Konstantinovich Pavlov, a rich man of the 2nd Zhemkonsky nasleg, was elected head of the church, and since 1910 Semyon Petrovich Barashkov is a well-known rich man of the Kachikatsky nasleg.
                                It is known from the archive of materials that G.K. Pavlov donated 500 rubles from himself and 2500 rubles collected from the population for the benefit of the church. And S.P. Barashkov donated 700 rubles from himself, and 300 rubles from his own population. For this patronage activity in 1912, both of them were awarded silver medals on the Stanislavskaya ribbon for wearing on the chest. It is interesting that in the presentation for the award S.P. Barashkov is signed by the foreman of the Kachikatsky nasleg Afanasy Eliseevich Kulakovsky. A parish school existed at the church from September 1, 1898. The parish was made up of the Yakuts of Kachikatsky and two Zhemkonsky naslegs, while the number of parishioners in 1914 was 4175 people.
                                All the churchmen knew the Yakut language, and the word of God was passed on to the local population in their native language. 
                                The architecture of the churches in Yakutia was not inferior to the churches of the central regions of Russia, only none of them had a gilded dome and such a rich interior decoration as in Russia. The only surviving Kachikat Nicholas Church in the village. During her long life, Kerdem has witnessed many events that gradually disappear from human memory with the change of generations. For example, in 1929, in the “year of the great turning point,” the activists of the Soviet government collected crosses and bells. And even earlier, on February 12-13, 1922, a tragic event took place near the church, when a small detachment led by a drunken commander hacked and shot the last priest and 16 civilians. The "fault" of the latter consisted in the fact that the rebels requisitioned hay from some of them, they shot someone under fear, and forced to collect candles from the population. The Reds saw in the actions of these unfortunates aiding the bandits.                                
                                During the Soviet era, the building of the church served as a club, warehouse for a long time, then it was completely idle, in the fall students who arrived for cleaning work were accommodated.
                                In February 1989, writer Suorun Omolloon, who was then working on the organization of the Sottin Museum, arrived with a decree from the Ministry of Culture to transfer the church building to the Sottin Museum. On the same evening, an urgent village meeting was called. All who arrived at the gathering unanimously decided to refuse. By the resolution of this gathering, it was decided to restore the building and create a historical and ethnographic museum on the basis of the church. Zakharov Robert Konstantinovich was appointed in charge. Since then, a lot of work has been done to improve and expand the museum.
                                In 1990. director of the state farm "50 years of October" N.F. Trofimov provided a 4-apartment building for the museum. In 1991, all the exhibits collected by the inhabitants of the nasleg were moved to a new house. The territory of the museum complex occupies 1 hectare of the highest hill in the village.
                                The building of the museum was built, an annex (gallery), in the middle of the building there is an open area for recreation, in it there is "Aal Luk Mas". All museum stands and exhibits tell about the life and development of the nasleg.
                                Since 1991, on the initiative of an enthusiast - local historian Zakharov R.K. in the village. The ethnographic museum complex "Samartai" was created in Kerdem. On the territory of the museum there are monuments of history and architecture: a unique, the only monument of architecture and history that has survived to this day in the ulus - the Kachikat Nikolaev Church, built in 1892; grain dryer of the rich philanthropist S. P. Barashkov; a six-sided house-babaryn, 18th century building; the two-level barn of the rich man Kirill Scriabin built in the 19th century to protect against the "robber Manchaara"; summer booth of the 18th century.
                                The museum itself contains unique exhibits that tell about the life and culture of the Yakuts, about the flora and fauna of our region, documents, photographs, exhibits on the history of the region and the village. You can also see Even, Yakut saddles with ancient silver coinage. Unique holidays (ysyakh, kuyur), sports competitions in national sports, ice sculpture competitions are held here. Tourists can get an idea of ​​the ancient culture of the Sakha people: hear the ringing of khomus and toyuk, see national rituals - purification, meeting the sun.
